# Distributed Operational Transform Network

A distributed Operational Transform (OT) network with quantum resistance and zero-knowledge proofs for multi-planetary deployment, designed for integration with the SIN application.

## Overview

This project implements a high-latency tolerant, quantum-resistant collaborative editing system that can operate across planetary distances. The system uses Operational Transform algorithms to manage concurrent edits across high-latency connections, quantum-resistant cryptography to secure against future quantum computer attacks, and zero-knowledge proofs to provide secure client-network interactions.

### Key Features

- **Operational Transform Engine**: Manages concurrent document edits with conflict resolution
- **Quantum Resistant Security**: Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for all secure communications
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Client authentication and data access without revealing sensitive information
- **Multi-Planetary Architecture**: Designed for high-latency inter-planetary communications
- **SIN Application Integration**: Seamless integration with the SIN application

## Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

### Core Components

- **OT Engine**: Implements the Operational Transform algorithm for concurrent editing
- **Network Topology**: Manages the distributed network across multiple planets
- **Planetary Node**: Represents a node in the network with planet-specific configuration
- **Communication Layer**: Handles message passing between nodes with high latency tolerance

### Security Components

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Implements post-quantum encryption and signatures
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Provides secure authentication and verification mechanisms
- **Key Exchange**: Quantum-resistant key exchange for secure communication

### APIs and Integration

- **API Server**: HTTP and WebSocket interfaces for client applications
- **SIN Integration**: Integration with the SIN application

### Simulation and Testing

- **Simulation Environment**: Simulates multi-planetary network conditions
